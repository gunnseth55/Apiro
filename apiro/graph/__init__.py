apiro.graph — belief graph data model and Phase 2 orchestration components.

Phase 1 (data model):
  BeliefGraph, Node, Edge

Phase 2 (orchestration):
  NodeExpander, ApiroTraversal, SaturationDetector, RabbitHoleDetector,
  ContradictionDetector (import directly: from apiro.graph.contradiction import ContradictionDetector)

Stubs (for testing without Ollama/ChromaDB/model download):
  StubEntropyEngine, StubChromaClient, StubLLMClient, CyclingStubLLMClient
